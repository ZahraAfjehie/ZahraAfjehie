## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zahra!

I'm a data and business analyst with a strong passion for the world of data analysis.

Here are some projects from my ongoing data analysis learning journey:



## Selecting the Top Five Competitors for FMCG Products

The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) project involves the task of identifying the market's five most similar competitors. To achieve this, FMCG products were grouped using the K-means algorithm, taking into consideration various metrics such as weight/volume, price, market share, penetration rate, and weighted distribution. The project's ultimate result is a functional tool that provides managers with a list of the top five competitors, allowing them to closely monitor their most significant rivals.

Here are the scatter plots representing clustering metrics, with different clusters depicted using varying colors to represent products within specific categories:
