## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zahra!

I'm a data and business analyst with a strong passion for the world of data analysis.

Here are some projects from my ongoing data analysis learning journey:



## Selecting the Top Five Competitors for FMCG Products

The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) project involves the task of identifying the market's five most similar competitors. To achieve this, FMCG products were grouped using the K-means algorithm, taking into consideration various metrics such as weight/volume, price, market share, penetration rate, and weighted distribution. The project's ultimate result is a functional tool that provides managers with a list of the top five competitors, allowing them to closely monitor their most significant rivals.

Here are the scatter plots representing clustering metrics, with different clusters depicted using varying colors to represent products within specific categories:

## SpaceShip-Titanic-Kaggle-Competition

  This project not only addresses a critical task in space travel but also provides an opportunity to showcase our data science skills in a competitive setting on Kaggle. [Full Project](https://github.com/ZahraAfjehie/SpaceShip-Titanic-Kaggle-Competition/blob/main/Kaggle_Titanic_Last.ipynb)
 
In the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition, the goal is to predict passenger survival on a futuristic interstellar spaceship. The dataset contains information about passengers, their cabin class, age, gender, and other attributes. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether passengers survived the journey.
The aim was to thoroughly understand the features and ensure a clean dataset before building models to predict the "Transported" target variable.

                              Sample plots generated during the statistical analysis.

Throughout the competition, I achieved my best submission by employing the GradientBoostingClassifier, conducting extensive experimentation, and attaining an 85% training score with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1944. Detailed analysis and results can be found in the notebook.

## Portfolio Projects
There are four distinct projects, each focusing on a specific skill within the data analysis field:

1. The first project involves Excel, where Pivot tables and dashboards are created using Buyer's Bike Sales data. [Bike Sales Dashboards in Excel](https://github.com/ZahraAfjehie/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)

2. The second project utilizes SQL to calculate various metrics and ratings for analyzing global COVID-19 deaths and vaccination statistics. [COVID 19
Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/ZahraAfjehie/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

3. The third project employs Power BI to transform data, create visualizations, and design dashboards for a dataset containing surveys from data professionals. [Data Professional Survey

4. The final project revolves around Tableau, where dashboards are generated using data sourced from Airbnb listings and reviews. [Airbnb Listings and Reviews Data Exploration in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zahra4196/viz/AirBnBFullProject_16944577478060/Dashboard1)

This portfolio project was completed as part of the data analytics bootcamp instructed by Alexander Freberg [AlexTheAnalyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst)
